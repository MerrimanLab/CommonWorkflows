# Merriman lab - common computational workflows  

This repository will hold basic instructions (with examples where possible) for typical computational workflows / protocols. We will slowly add to this repository over time, and eventually this repository should serve as a good reference document for new and existing lab members. We will make every effort to keep this up-to-date and relevant. If you have a good idea for something to add, please do. Or if you think that something needs to be edited / updated, please jump in. As you new protocols and examples, please add them to the contents below with a short description.
