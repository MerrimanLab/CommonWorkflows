# VCFWrangling
This repository covers basic VCF manipulation (subsetting, filtering, merging etc.) using BCFTOOLS. There are a myriad of tools to manipulate VCF files, this repository is limited to BCFTools where possible and serves as a standard protocol for the laboratory. Users are welcome to use their favourite tool if they have a strong preference.

## Example Datasets  

All of the example workflows in this repository use the example VCF files in the ```ExampleVCF``` folder.  
These VCF files are CHR 19 of 7 individuals of the 1000 Genomes project.  

## Contents  

  1. Merging & Selecting Regions from multiple VCF files  
     A typical workflow to combine individual genotypes into one VCF file and extract selected regions of interest from this combined file is shown.  
  2. Extracting particular samples from a VCF file  
     We show how to select particular samples from a VCF file
